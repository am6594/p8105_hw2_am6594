Year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrapper,
sports_balls, homes_powered, trash_wheel. The combined dataset has a
total of 1033 data. For available data, the total weight of trash
collected by Professor Trash Wheel 246.74 and the total number of
cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022 1.812^{4}.

# Problem 3

``` r
#Rename each CSV for consistency
colnames(bakers) = c('Name', 'Series', 'Age', 'Occupation', 'Hometown')
colnames(bakes) = c('Series', 'Episode','Name', 'Signature Bake', 'Show Stopper')
colnames(results) = c('Series', 'Episode', 'Name', 'Technical', 'Result')

#Remove the last name for each baker in 'bakers.csv'
bakers$Name <- sub(" .*", "", bakers$Name)

#Convert 'Age' in 'bakers_clean' to integer
bakers_clean <- bakers %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(Age = as.integer(Age),
         Series = as.integer(Series))

#Convert 'Episode' and 'Series in 'bakes_clean' to integer
bakes_clean <- bakes %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(Series = as.integer(Series),
         Episode = as.integer(Episode))

#Convert 'Episode', 'Series', and 'Technical' in 'results_clean' to integer
results_clean <- results %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(Series = as.integer(Series),
         Episode = as.integer(Episode),
         Technical = as.integer(Technical))

#Check for completeness and correctness across datasets
bakes_not_in_bakers <- anti_join(bakes_clean, bakers_clean, by = c("Series", "Name"))
results_not_in_bakes <- anti_join(results_clean, bakes_clean, by = c("Series", "Episode", "Name"))
```

``` r
#Merge to a single, final dataset
combined_baker <- bakers %>% left_join(bakes, by = c("Name", "Series"))
combined_baker <- left_join(combined_baker, results, by = c("Series", "Episode", "Name"))

#Organize the variables in meaningful order
combined_baker <- combined_baker %>%
  select(Name, Series, Episode, `Signature Bake`, `Show Stopper`, Technical, Result, Age, Hometown, Occupation)

#Clean the final dataset
combined_baker <-  combined_baker%>%
  filter(!is.na(Technical))

#Export the final dataset
output_path <- "~/Desktop/p8105_hw2_am6594/data/final_baker_dataset.csv" #Define the output path
write_csv(combined_baker, output_path) # Export the final dataset as a CSV file
```

Data cleaning process: My data cleaning process starts with importing
the three CSV. After checking for the column’s name, I renamed the
column across three CSV to ensure consistency and prepare for later
merging. Then, I converted all numeric columns, such as “Age,” into
integers. After that, I checked for completeness and correctness across
datasets to ensure successful merging. Initially, the merge of the
dataset failed. So I revisited my preparation process and realized each
baker’s name was shown as full name, including first name and last name,
in ‘bakers.csv’, while only showing first name in the other two CSV.
Thus, after importing the dataset, I add another line to remove the last
name.

Final dataset brief: The final dataset was named
‘final_baker_dataset.csv.’ The final CSV contains 533 datasets. The
final output was ordered: Name, Series, Episode, Signature Bake, Show
Stopper, Technical, Result, Age, Hometown, and Occupation. In this
order, people can prioritize identifying information first, then baking
performance-related columns, followed by supplementary biographical data
at the end, enhancing readability.

``` r
#create a table showing the star baker or winner of each episode Seasons 5 through 10
star_baker_data <- combined_baker %>%
  filter(Series >= 5 & Series <= 10, Result %in% c("STAR BAKER", "WINNER")) %>%
  select(Series, Episode, Name, Result) %>%
  arrange(Series, Episode)

#Convert to tibble
star_baker_tibble <- as_tibble(star_baker_data)

#Check for any predictable overall winners by listing all the names that appear more than twice
name_counts <- star_baker_tibble %>%
  count(Name, sort = TRUE)
names_more_than_twice <- name_counts %>%
  filter(n > 2)
```

The table was listed in Series order, starting with Season 5 Episode 1.
Some predictable winners had won Star Baker or Winner more than twice
over the five seasons. These are the relatively predictable winners:
Richard, Candice, Nadiya, Ian, Sophie, Steven. On the other hand, many
bakers appeared as surprise winners by only winning the star baker or
winner once over the five seasons.

## Part 2: ‘viewers.csv’

``` r
#Import viewers.csv
viewers = read_csv("~/Desktop/p8105_hw2_am6594/data/viewers.csv", col_names = T)
```

    ## Rows: 10 Columns: 11
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (11): Episode, Series 1, Series 2, Series 3, Series 4, Series 5, Series ...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
#Convert the format of the table
viewer_clean <- viewers %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Series"),  # Select all columns starting with "Series"
               names_to = "Series",           # New column for Series names
               values_to = "Viewership")      # New column for viewership values

#Extract the series number from the "Series" column
viewer_clean <- viewer_clean %>%
  mutate(Series = as.integer(gsub("Series ", "", Series)))

#Calculate the average viewership for Seasons 1
average_season1 <- viewer_clean %>%
  filter(Series == 1) %>% 
  summarize(Average_Viewership = mean(Viewership, na.rm = TRUE))

#Calculate the average viewership for Seasons 5
average_season5 <- viewer_clean %>%
  filter(Series == 5) %>% 
  summarize(Average_Viewership = mean(Viewership, na.rm = TRUE))

#The first 10 rows of this dataset
head(viewer_clean, 10)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 3
    ##    Episode Series Viewership
    ##      <dbl>  <int>      <dbl>
    ##  1       1      1       2.24
    ##  2       1      2       3.1 
    ##  3       1      3       3.85
    ##  4       1      4       6.6 
    ##  5       1      5       8.51
    ##  6       1      6      11.6 
    ##  7       1      7      13.6 
    ##  8       1      8       9.46
    ##  9       1      9       9.55
    ## 10       1     10       9.62

The average viewership in Season 1 and in Season 5 is 2.77 and 10.0393
respectively.
